This library began as a fork of Jeanine Adkisson and Han Seoul-Oh's most
excellent [Parsimmon](https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon) parser combinator
library, which implementation and tests I've since completely rewritten and
taken in a different direction.

I originally forked because I wanted to see how far I could push modularity and
extensibility, the craziness of which sounded to me definitely far out of scope
for Parsimmon.
